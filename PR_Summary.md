## Work Completed

### Initial Feature Development
- **Soil Demand Trend Analysis**: Developed a new chart component to visualize soil demand patterns
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Connected with protocol's `LibEvaluate.sol` logic for demand calculation
- **GraphQL Enhancement**: Added `deltaPodDemand` field to retrieve protocol-computed demand data
- **Three-State Categorization**: Implemented demand classification (Increasing/Steady/Decreasing)

### Technical Implementation
- Created `useSeasonalSoilDemandTrend` hook with threshold-based demand mapping
- Built responsive chart component with time period filtering
- Integrated with existing Field Explorer page layout
- Applied consistent styling and interaction patterns

### Iterations & Refinements
- **Format Standardization**: Converted to match existing chart visual style
- **Y-Axis Improvements**: Added proper buffering and text labels for better UX
- **Code Quality**: Applied formatting standards and maintained clean architecture

### Final Decision
- **Feature Removal**: Per stakeholder feedback, completely removed the soil demand trend feature
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all associated code, hooks, GraphQL fields, and components
- **Layout Restoration**: Reverted to original 2-column Field Explorer layout
